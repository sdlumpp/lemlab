## Description
The results in the paper are split up into Monte Carlo simulations (section 3.1 in the paper) and a time complexity 
analysis (appendix C in the paper). Therefore, this folder contains two subfolders with the names *monte_carlo* 
and *time_complexity*. Please, refer to the readmes in the two subfolders for detailed instructions.
